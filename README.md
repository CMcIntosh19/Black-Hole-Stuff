# Untitled EMRI Code
## A Python Toolkit for generating and displaying generic Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals
Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals are binary systems consisting of a massive or supermassive black hole orbited by a much smaller object, such that the mass ratio between them is $\leq$ 10<sup>-4</sup>. 
EMRI systems are expected to be potent emitters of gravitational radiation as well as a thorough test of General Relativity in regions of extreme gravity, 
which makes them of great interest to astronomers and astrophysicists in the field of multi-messenger astronomy.

As part of the ongoing effort to study EMRI systems, this package is being developed as a tool to generate orbits across as much of the parameter space as possible. 
The project is currently incomplete, and documentation is being updated daily.

Packages Used:
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Sympy
- PyWavelets

## Future Functionality Goals
- Full/Partial Tidal Disruption of smaller body
- Accretion Disk interaction
- Higher order corrections to energy loss calculations
- Affects of non-zero smaller body spin
